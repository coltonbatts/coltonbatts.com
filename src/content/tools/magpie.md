Magpie is built on a simple principle: your notes and snippets belong to you, not a server. Everything is stored locally, searchable instantly, and exportable at any time.

No accounts, no sync conflicts, no subscription fees. Just a tool that gets out of your way and lets you collect what matters.

The interface is minimal by design. No AI suggestions, no social features, no distractions. It's a digital filing cabinet that respects your workflow and your privacy.
