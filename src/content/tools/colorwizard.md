ColorWizard started as a personal tool for checking contrast ratios, then grew into a full palette generator. It runs entirely in the browser—no API calls, no data collection, no external dependencies.

The goal is straightforward: help designers and developers create accessible color schemes without relying on external services or complex design tools. Everything you need is right there in the browser.

It uses the WCAG contrast algorithm to ensure your colors meet accessibility standards. Generate variations, test combinations, and export what you need. Simple, fast, and private.
