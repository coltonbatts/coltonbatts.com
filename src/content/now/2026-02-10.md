Tonight I built **VCR** — a headless motion graphics renderer that compiles declarative YAML scenes into broadcast-quality ProRes 4444 video with alpha transparency.

**The vibe:**
- GPU-accelerated on Apple Silicon via Metal
- Expression-driven animation (sin, cos, lerp, noise, glitch, etc.)
- Custom WGSL fragment shaders
- CLI-first, no GUI, no Electron

**Features shipped:**
- 8 procedural primitives (circle, polygon, rounded_rect, etc.)
- Native text rendering with Geist Pixel font family
- Layered compositing with z-order, transforms, and alpha blending
- Deterministic rendering (same input = same output)
- ~2.5s render time for 5s 1440p video on M1 Max

**Stack:**
- Rust
- Metal / GPU Compute
- FFmpeg (ProRes encoding)
- WGSL Shaders
- fontdue for text

The killer feature: render a YAML manifest and drop the .mov directly into Premiere, Resolve, or any NLE with full alpha. Perfect for compositing animated text on Midjourney/video output.
