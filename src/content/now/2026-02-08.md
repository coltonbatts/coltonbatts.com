Geist Pixel dropped and I basically stopped everything to rebuild this site around it.

I’m not using it as a novelty effect. I’m using it as a system voice.

What clicked for me is that it still feels engineered: strict grid, predictable spacing, consistent rhythm, and clean alignment with Geist Sans/Mono. It has personality, but it doesn’t fall apart in production.

The five variants are ridiculous in the best way:

- Square
- Grid
- Circle
- Triangle
- Line

That gives me a full typographic palette without leaving one family. I can keep structure tight and still change tone from section to section.

## Why I rebuilt tonight

I wanted the site to feel more like terminal-era editorial design:

- black + white only
- visible pixel construction
- no soft gradients
- no fuzzy shadows
- clean hierarchy, hard edges, functional rhythm

So tonight I rolled back unfinished experiments, cleaned the homepage typography, and pushed the whole thing toward a quieter, more technical look.

## What I like about Geist Pixel

- It’s expressive without getting sloppy
- It keeps the geometric build visible (circles/triangles/lines)
- It mixes with modern UI patterns without feeling fake-retro
- It can carry both utility text and hero moments

I love type that looks like it was made by constraints, not decoration.

Geist Pixel nails that.
