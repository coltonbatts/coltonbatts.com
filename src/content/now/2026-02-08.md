Vercel dropped Geist Pixel and yeah, I immediately redid my site with it.

This font is sick.

What I like:

- strict grid
- clean spacing
- still readable
- works in real UI, not just dribbble noise

I wanted the site to feel more technical and less polished/soft.

So tonight I:

- removed the unfinished ASCII stuff
- cleaned up homepage type
- made the look black + white only
- switched to a simpler date-based now log

Still tuning, but this is way closer to what I want.
