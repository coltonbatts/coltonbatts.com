Tonight I built **Chroma** — a native offline color tool for artists.

**The vibe:**
- Native macOS app via Tauri
- Pure black UI with Geist Pixel font
- Terminal-first workflow (`chroma` command to launch)
- No browser, no localhost, just the app

**Features shipped:**
- Color picker with RGB sliders
- Image color extraction (dropper mode)
- DMC floss matching (454 colors, Delta-E Lab matching)
- Palette persistence
- Hot reload dev workflow

**Stack:**
- Tauri 2 + React + Vite
- TypeScript
- TailwindCSS
- culori for color science
- Custom skill system for agent orchestration

It's day one but it's already sick. Open terminal, type `chroma`, app opens. That's the workflow.
