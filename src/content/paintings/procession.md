A nocturnal procession through an unnamed street. The figures emerge from deep red underpainting — their forms suggested rather than defined. The light source is ambiguous, somewhere between streetlamp and memory.

This piece began as a study in movement across a horizontal plane. The figures repeat but never duplicate — each silhouette carries its own weight, its own direction.
