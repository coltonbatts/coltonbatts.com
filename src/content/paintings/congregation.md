A crowd resolving from abstraction. The figures press upward, reaching toward something just outside the frame. The composition is deliberately claustrophobic — there is no sky, no horizon line, only bodies and intention.

The red undertone bleeds through every layer, giving the scene an internal heat that feels devotional.
